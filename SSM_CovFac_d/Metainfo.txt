Name of QuantLet: SSM_CovFac_d

Published in: Linear Time Series With MATLAB and Octave

Description: 'The autocovariances of a vector moving averrage process of order one are first computed and
               then the spectral factorization of these covariances is performed using two methods.'

Keywords: time-series, spectral factorization, vector moving average, autocovariances, polynomial methods, state space methods
